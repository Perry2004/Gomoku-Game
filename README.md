# Gomoku Game in CLI with Java
## Introduction
This is a simple Java practice project at the time when I was learning Java.   
This is a simple Gomoku game implemented in CLI with Java. The game is played between two players. The game board will be displayed in the console. The players will take turns to place their pieces on the board by entering the row and column number. The player who first connects 5 pieces in a row, column or diagonal wins the game. The game will end when one of the players wins or the board is full.   
## How to play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Start the game by running the `Gomoku.java` file (through an IDE or command line).
3. Follow the instructions in the console to play the game by entering the row and column number.
4. The game will end when one of the players wins or the board is full.
5. Enjoy the game!
